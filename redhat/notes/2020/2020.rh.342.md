A Basic Input Output System (BIOS)-powered system goes through a number of steps from being powered down to having a running Red Hat Enterprise Linux system. The following list gives a high-level overview of the steps being taken. This list also applies to virtual machines that emulate a traditional BIOS system. This list assumes that the grub2 boot loader is being used. For different boot loaders, the list will differ.

The BIOS firmware is started and performs a Power On Self Test (POST).

The BIOS scans for (possible) boot devices, and orders them according to a user-set preference.

The boot devices are scanned in order for a boot firmware (such as a PXE ROM on network cards), an Master Boot Record (MBR), or a partition marked as bootable. If found, the BIOS executes it.

The first-stage boot loader stored in the MBR loads the stage 1.5 (drivers) and stage 2 boot loader from disk and executes it.

The boot loader loads a configuration file from disk. In the case of grub2, this will be /boot/grub2/grub.cfg.

The configuration file is parsed, and based on its contents, a boot entry is selected automatically or by the user.

The kernel and initial ramdisk referenced in the boot entry are loaded from disk, and control is handed over to the kernel.

The kernel starts, and initializes hardware using the drivers found in the initial ramdisk. A simple init system is also started from the ramdisk.

The scripts in the initial ramdisk mount the root file system of the target system, then switch root to the newly mounted file system, and hand over control to /sbin/init on the target root file system.

The init system mounts file systems and starts services according to its configuration.

```bash
# /etc/default/grub
# GRUB_TIMEOUT
# GRUB_DEFAULT
# GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX
grub2-mkconfig -o /boot/grub2/grub.cfg

chroot /mnt/sysimage
grub2-install /dev/vda
